                   <br>
                   <p>A bug fix is a change to the code that addresses an identified bug. It's important to note that a bug fix doesn't always mean the problem has been fixed â€“ 
                    it could simply be a workaround until a more permanent solution can be implemented. 
                    There is no one perfect way to fix bugs</p>

                    A hackathon, also known as a codefest, is a social coding event that brings computer programmers 
                    and other interested people together to improve upon or build a new software program</p>

                <p>Competitive Programming is a mental sport where the contestants called sport programmers have to solve coding problems using maths, 
                    data structures and algorithms with various restrictions like memory limit, execution time within a set time limit.

                <h2>Blind coding</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Blind coding is where a programmer works on code without running it until completion. 
                    Normally this is a terrible idea but it makes for a very fun challenge.The aim of competitive programming is to write source code of computer programs which are able to solve given problems.

                <p>A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects. 
                    Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills. </p>
